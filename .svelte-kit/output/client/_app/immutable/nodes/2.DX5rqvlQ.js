        reactions. These materials, which consist of small transition metal nanoclusters confined within three-dimensional zeolite pores, 
        are interesting because they show higher stability and better sintering resistance under reaction conditions. While several such 
        hybrid catalysts have been reported experimentally, key questions such as the impact of the zeolite frameworks on the properties 
        of the metal clusters are not well understood. To address such knowledge gaps, in this study, we report a robust and transferable 
        machine learning-based potential (MLP) that is capable of describing the structure, stability, and dynamics of zeolite-confined 
        gold nanoclusters. Specifically, we show that the resulting MLP maintains ab initio accuracy across a range of temperatures 
        (300–1000 K) and can be used to investigate time scales (>10 ns), length scales (ca. 10,000 atoms), and phenomena (e.g., 
        ensemble-averaged stability and diffusivity) that are typically inaccessible using density functional theory (DFT). Taken together, 
        this study represents an important step in enabling the rational theory-guided design of metal@zeolite catalysts.</p></div></div> <div class="publication svelte-1luc0za"><img src="/hea_paper.jpg" alt="Publication Figure" class="paper-image svelte-1luc0za"> <div class="paper-details svelte-1luc0za"><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c03401" class="title svelte-1luc0za">Developing Cheap but Useful Machine Learning-Based Models for Investigating High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts</a> <p class="details svelte-1luc0za">Langmuir 2024</p> <p class="authors svelte-1luc0za">Authors: <strong>Chenghan Sun</strong>, Rajat Goel, Ambarish R. Kulkarni.</p> <p class="abstract svelte-1luc0za">This work aims to address the challenge of developing interpretable ML-based models when access to large-scale computational 
        resources is limited. Using CoMoFeNiCu high-entropy alloy catalysts as an example, we present a cost-effective workflow that 
        synergistically combines descriptor-based approaches, machine learning-based force fields, and low-cost density functional theory 
        (DFT) calculations to predict high-quality adsorption energies for H, N, and NHx (x = 1, 2, and 3) adsorbates. This is achieved 
        using three specific modifications to typical DFT workflows including: (1) using a sequential optimization protocol, (2) developing 
        a new geometry-based descriptor, and (3) repurposing the already-available low-cost DFT optimization trajectories to develop a 
        ML-FF. Taken together, this study illustrates how cost-effective DFT calculations and appropriately designed descriptors can be 
        used to develop cheap but useful models for predicting high-quality adsorption energies at significantly lower computational costs. 
        We anticipate that this resource-efficient philosophy may be broadly relevant to the larger surface catalysis community.</p></div></div></section> <section id="experience" class="svelte-1luc0za"><h2 class="svelte-1luc0za">Industry Experience</h2> <div class="experience-list svelte-1luc0za"><div class="experience-item svelte-1luc0za"><div class="experience-logo svelte-1luc0za"><img src="/meta_logo.jpg" alt="Meta Logo" class="svelte-1luc0za"></div> <div class="experience-details svelte-1luc0za"><h3 class="svelte-1luc0za">Meta</h3> <p class="svelte-1luc0za">Data Scientist Intern</p> <p class="svelte-1luc0za">Affiliation: <span class="affiliation">Ads Problem DS Team, Business Integrity</span></p> <p class="experience-dates svelte-1luc0za">June. 2022 – Sep. 2022, Seattle, WA</p></div></div></div></section> <section id="showcase" class="svelte-1luc0za"><img src="/showcase-image.jpg" alt="Showcase Image" class="svelte-1luc0za"></section> <footer id="footer" class="svelte-1luc0za"><p>Designed by <strong>Chenghan Sun</strong>, powered by <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" class="svelte-1luc0za">Svelte</a> and <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" target="_blank" class="svelte-1luc0za">SvelteKit</a>.</p></footer>`,1);function r(e){var a=i();l(8),s(e,a)}export{r as component};
